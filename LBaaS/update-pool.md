Updates an existing pool on an LBaaS instance for a given account in a given data center. Calls to this operation must include a token acquired from the authentication endpoint. See the [Login API](../Authentication/login.md) for information on acquiring this token.

### When to Use It

Use this API operation when you need to modify the configuration of an existing pool on a load balancer. 

## URL

### Structure

    PUT https://api.loadbalancer.ctl.io/{accountAlias}/{dataCenter}/loadbalancers/{loadBalancerId}/pools/{poolId}

### Example

    PUT https://api.loadbalancer.ctl.io/DV01/NY1/loadbalancers/329a98e6-977a-4c25-a7c8-174209fe1d31/pools/a4ad7c71-1575-400e-8eb2-cef74ed557ad

### Content Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Req. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | The id of the pool | Yes |
| port | integer | The port on which incoming traffic will send requests. Valid port ranges are between `23` and `65534` | Yes |

| idleTimeout | integer | Timeout value for idle client connections to backend nodes in milliseconds - defaults to 180000 | No |
| loadBalancingMode | string | Indicates the type of load balancing â€“ `tcp` or `http` (layer4-TCP or layer7-HTTP(s)) | Yes |
| nodes | array | Collection of entity values that describe the customer backend nodes being load balanced | No |
| forceHttps | boolean | Will redirect incoming traffic on port 80 to port 443. loadBalancingMode must be set to `tcp` and port must be set to `443` | No |
| healthCheck | object | Configures a health check that is applied to all nodes in the pool, provided they do not already have a healthCheck configured | No |

### Node Properties

### HealthCheck Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Req. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| unhealthyThreshold | integer | Number of times server healthcheck can fail befre being removed from rotation. Valid range between `2` and `10` | Yes |
| healthyThreshold | integer | Number of times unhealthy servers must pass healthcheck before being readded to rotation. Valid range is between `2` and `10` | Yes |
| intervalSeconds | integer | Seconds to wait between healthchecks. Valid range is between `5` and `300` | Yes |
| targetPort | integer | Port of the healthcheck on the server | Yes |
| mode | string | Mode over which to send healthcheck. Options are `TCP`, `SSL`, `HTTP`. Defaults to `TCP` | No |
