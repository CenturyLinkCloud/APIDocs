The Relational DataBase Services (RDBS) API focuses on manipulating Subscriptions to the RDBS service. A Subscription includes the backing database server(s), certificates, database backups, and notifications.

You can also view RDBS billing, action history, and promotions applied to your account.

The RDBS api is a satellite of the platform API and offered on a separate URL.
